What do you do when you can't find the extension you're looking for? Make it yourself.

Created because I have a bad habit of having at least 50+ tabs open at all times and it was severely taxing my system; I tried searching for something like this but all I figured it would be easier to write one myself. Its function is quite simple yet invaluable (to me at least) -- whenever you try to open a tab past the set limit, it will automatically kill that tab and display a notification saying you exceeded your quota (forcing you to choose a tab to kill).
